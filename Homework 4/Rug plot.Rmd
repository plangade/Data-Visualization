```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown
This rmd file shows a deom_rug graph created with geom_rug, which shows the positions of the data points along x and y are denoted by tick marks, reminiscent of the tassels on a rug. 

```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
library(readxl)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
UNdata <- read_excel('UNdata.xlsx',sheet = 1)
p <- ggplot(UNdata, aes(HDI,LifeExp, label = country, color=Edu)) + geom_jitter() +  geom_rug(alpha = 1/2, position = "jitter",sides="trbl")  + geom_point() + scale_x_continuous(name="Human Development Index") + scale_y_continuous(name="Life Expectancy")+labs(colour = "Education")
ggplotly(p)
```

End of assignment :)
